# Tinfoil Directory

This repository is a maintained directory of all active Tinfoil shops for use with the Tinfoil application on the Nintendo Switch. I will not share the list of shops for reasons.

## How to Use
Instead of downloading the `shops.tfl` file, you should point Tinfoil directly to the hosted file. Although, you could download and host it yourself.:

- **Protocol:** https
- **Host:** codehedge.github.io
- **Path:** TinfoilDirectory/shops.tfl
- **Title:** Shop Directory

Tinfoil will automatically detect and use the list of shops contained in the file.

## What is a `.tfl` file?
A `.tfl` file is a custom index file used by Tinfoil to provide a list of shops, games, or content sources. It is typically a JSON file that has been encrypted for use with Tinfoil.

- **shops.tfl**: This file contains the current, active list of Tinfoil shops.


## Maintenance
This directory is actively maintained. Old or inactive shops are disabled to improve Tinfoil's load times. New, working shops are added as they become available. If you have a shop to add or update, please email me at hedge@edgeofhedge.com.

**Note:** This repository does not host or distribute any copyrighted content. It only provides a list of shop endpoints for use with Tinfoil. We do the work so you dont have to, simply add our repo once, and stay up to date with the rapidly changing shop scene.
